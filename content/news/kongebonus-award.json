  "fullContent": "We have added yet another trophy to our cabinet after Peter & Sons was named Rising Star Game Developer of the Year at the prestigious Kongebonus Awards 2025.\n\nSince our first game hit online casino lobbies back in 2019, we have been working hard to create great slots built around amazing themes and with immersive mechanics and gameplay.\n\nThis award marks a major milestone in our journey as we push ahead with our bold ambitions to become a top-tier online casino content provider.\n\nThis was a hotly contested category, and we were up against serious competition but thankfully we were the studio to take home the trophy on the night.\n\nThat the Kongebonus Awards are voted for by players makes this win even more special â€“ at the end of the day, we create games for players first and foremost.\n\nAs a small studio, it's been tough to break into the market and get our games in front of players, but this award shows we are on the right track and that players like what we are doing.\n\nA big thanks to the team at Kongebonus for putting us forward for the award, and for the players that voted for us to win.\n\nCheck out our full interview about our Kongebonus Awards win here."
